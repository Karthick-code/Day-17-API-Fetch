this file belongs to karthick
it contains
    -> index.html file
    -> Script.js file which fetches data from restcountries API for country details and Openweather 
    API for weather details 
    -> Style.css file for styling

While clicking on the "click for Weather" button the weather details are show in alert message

(Important)-> Some times restcountries API is not working to retrive datas. it may occur while evaluating,
so i wanted to inform it. if there is 404 error it's because of restcountries API. Because of this reason 
took me this long to complete the task. Another thing is names displayed in alert may vary, its 
because the names are retrived from the OpenWeather API.
